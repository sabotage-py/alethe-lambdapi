Translate Alethe proofs to Lambdapi
===================================

This is a program `a2lp` (still underconstruction) to generate a Lambdapi file from the given SMT2 input file and the Alethe file, where the latter is an SMT solver's ouput for the aforementioned SMT2 input file).

[Alethe](https://verit.loria.fr/documentation/alethe-spec.pdf) is a proof format to represent unsatisfiability proofs generated by SMT solvers (in particular veriT).

[Lambdapi](https://github.com/Deducteam/lambdapi) is a proof assistant
based on the λΠ-calculus modulo rewriting. You may refer to [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.00543.pdf).

A sibling [package](https://github.com/sabotage-py/alethe-lambdapi-encoding) is required to check and run the output of this program. It encodes some preliminary logic and simple Alethe proof rules in Lambdapi. This program is entirely dependent on it. To understand the workings of the translation part of this program, you'd need to know how logic and simple rules are encoded in the sibling program.

Compilation from the source
---------------------------

You can get the source using `git` as follows:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sabotage-py/alethe-lambdapi
```
Dependencies are described in `a2lp.opam`.

To compile Lambdapi, just run the command `make` in the source directory.

You can run `a2lp` without installing it with `dune exec -- a2lp [smt2 file] [alethe file]`.


Source files
------------

The decision to write this program on top of the [Alethe parser](https://github.com/NotBad4U/reconstruction) was made due to the unavailability of the said parser on `opam`.

The following files remain (mostly) unchanged from https://github.com/NotBad4U/reconstruction and are required for parsing the Alethe files. The copyright for these belong to the original author.
- `lib/ast.ml`: type definitions required for parsing the alethe file.
- `lib/lexer.mll`
- `lib/parse.ml`
- `parser.mly`
